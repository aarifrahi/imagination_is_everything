<p style="font-family:'abeatbyKai';"><b>STOP LITTERING AROUND</b></p><p>Yes, we should learn from the Swach Bharat campaign! There was a reason we needed it in the first place. The fact that even the new PM of the country addressed the issue on such a gigantic level proves that we, as a country, are in dire need of cleanliness! Things as simple as throwing garbage in the bin and not spitting on the streets can make a huge difference.</p>

<p style="font-family:'abeatbyKai';"><b>BE ENVIRONMENT FRIENDLY</b></p><p>If you've been following the news, you'd know that it's been said that Delhi currently has the filthiest air, almost the same level as Beijing. In such conditions, being environment-friendly can have a huge impact on making our country a better place with better air. Plant a tree, use eco-friendly materials in your daily life, use public transport or carpool, get your vehicles checked for pollution control. There's so much you can do for this cause with such little effort.</p>

It would help the country’s future in a big way if every well-earning person would contribute. The overall literacy could definitely improve in our country.</p>

<p style="font-family:'abeatbyKai';"><b>STOP PARTICIPATING IN CORRUPTION</b></p><p>Don’t accept bribes and don’t give bribes. It’s really as simple as that. It starts with you and ends with you. Bribing traffic cops to get out of not paying that challan, or bribing officials to get that passport or driving license renewed, we all tend to bribe. Yes, it’s true that it’s tough to get things done in this country on many levels if bribing is not involved, but there has to be a start to the change. Let that be you.</p>

<p style="font-family:'abeatbyKai';"><b>BE BETTER NEIGHBOURS</b></p><p>At first, this may seem pointless. But being good neighbours to each other gives us a sense of community. We're all so engrossed in our lives that nobody knows even the names of the people living next door! At a time of immediate need, it's the people living closest to you who can help. Your neighbourhood gives you a sense of belonging, making your surroundings a better place to live in.</p>

The population of our country is so huge that any number of donations would be welcome. We have celebs like Aishwarya Rai associated with eye donation campaign. Celebs like Kamal Hassan and Priyanka Chopra have also pledged to donate their organs.</p>

<p style="font-family:'abeatbyKai';"><b>DONATE BLOOD</b></p><p>There are a lot of life-threatening diseases out there for which a patient requires blood. India also has one of the highest numbers when it comes to road accidents. Currently, India is facing a blood shortage of as much as three million units, and according to experts, the problem could be solved if only two percent more of the population would donate blood. You could be a part of that two percent. Blood donation drives are pretty common these days, at offices and at special camps. All you have to do is participate and donate.</p>

<p style="font-family:'abeatbyKai';"><b>GET OUT AND VOTE</b></p><p>As simple as that. Every time there are elections around the corner, we see massive campaigns urging people to get out and vote. That’s because statistics say not many people vote. And a good chunk of this is the urban population. Voting directly has an impact on making our country better. So go get inked.</p>

<p style="font-family:'abeatbyKai';"><b>HELP THOSE IN NEED</b></p><p>As much as possible in your capacity. If you know there’s domestic violence happening next door, if you find some accident victim on the road, if you know your friend is too drunk to drive; there are a lot of situations in which you can help others and avoid disasters. We have to let go of this mentality of not getting into others' business. Helping someone in need doesn’t mean getting tangled in a mess. It simply means you're kind enough to care about other people.</p>
